## 🧠 My Coding Philosophy: Human Creativity + AI Precision

I’m an entry-level programmer who combines hands-on problem-solving with AI-assisted development. Using ChatGPT as a productivity tool, I accelerate routine tasks like boilerplate setup, refactoring, and testing — while maintaining full control over debugging, architecture, and project design. 

Each project I build is a collaboration between critical human reasoning and machine precision. I treat ChatGPT as a co-pilot, not a crutch — feeding it real-world results, error logs, and context while steering the creative and technical direction myself. 

This workflow allows me to move quickly, learn continuously, and turn challenges into teachable moments that sharpen both my coding and analytical skills. My current focus areas include **C#**, **Avalonia UI**, and **cross-platform app development**.

# 🍔 Wendy's Menu – Visual Basic (VB.NET) Portfolio Project

### 👨‍💻 Author: Zacharius Harris  
> *Entry-Level IT Professional in Training | Aspiring Programmer | Visual Basic Portfolio Project*

---

## 📘 Overview
The **Wendy's Menu Project** is a Visual Basic (.NET WinForms) application that simulates a Wendy’s restaurant ordering system.  
It allows users to select menu items, calculate order totals, apply tax, and display the final amount due — similar to what a point-of-sale (POS) system would do in a real restaurant.

This project demonstrates my understanding of:
- GUI development using **Windows Forms**
- Event-driven programming
- Input validation
- Basic arithmetic logic for totals and taxes
- File and form structure organization in **VB.NET**

---

## ⚙️ Features
✅ User-friendly menu interface  
✅ Price calculation per selected item  
✅ Subtotal, tax, and total computation  
✅ Receipt-style output  
✅ Clear and Exit buttons  
✅ Modular design with separate forms (`Form1.vb`, `Wendys.vb`, `WendysMenu2.vb`)  

---

## 🧠 Technical Stack
- **Language:** Visual Basic .NET  
- **Framework:** .NET Framework / WinForms  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio  
- **OS:** Windows 10/11

## 💡 Learning Takeaways
Through this project, I practiced:
- Designing responsive user interfaces  
- Using **event handlers** (e.g., `Button_Click` events)  
- Managing project files (`.sln`, `.vbproj`, `.resx`)  
- Understanding how WinForms applications are built and executed
