## 📘 Overview
The **Wendy's Menu Project** is a Visual Basic (.NET WinForms) application that simulates a Wendy’s restaurant ordering system.  
It allows users to select menu items, calculate order totals, apply tax, and display the final amount due — similar to what a point-of-sale (POS) system would do in a real restaurant.

This project demonstrates my understanding of:
- GUI development using **Windows Forms**
- Event-driven programming
- Input validation
- Basic arithmetic logic for totals and taxes
- File and form structure organization in **VB.NET**
